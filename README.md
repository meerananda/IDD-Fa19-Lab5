# Jack in the Box

*A lab report by Meera Nanda*

## In this Report

For this weekâ€™s lab, we will be building a Jack in the box; this is a project inspired by the known toy. We will use this lab to help you to experiment with digital fabrication tools. The methods that will be used are 3D printing and laser cutting.

For the "Jack", I decided to print a flying saucer for my space-themed box. Here is a [link](/UFO.stl) to the .stl file.
